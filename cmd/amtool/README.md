# Generating amtool artifacts

Amtool comes with the option to create a number of ease-of-use artifacts that can be created.

## Shell completion

A bash completion script can be generated by calling `amtool --completion-script-bash`.

The bash completion file can be added to `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.

## Man pages

A man page can be generated by calling `amtool --help-man`.

Man pages can be added to the man directory of your choice

    amtool --help-man > /usr/local/share/man/man1/amtool.1
    sudo mandb

Then you should be able to view the man pages as expected.
